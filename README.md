# Extract data from CricInfo
This is an automation project which will go to the worldcup 2019 page on cricinfo's website. From there, it'll create an excel file containing sheets of different teams
having scores of their matches with opponents. Also, it'll create pdfs of all the teams containing scores with their opponents.
